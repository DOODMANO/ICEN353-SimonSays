Technical view
The Simon Says Game is expressed with a circuit with a few components, includes: Arduino board, wires, power (battery), LEDs, Push buttons, buzzer, capacitors, codes that control the gameplay.

A wire is connected to the Arduino kit and the pins on board, as there is no specific pin we must choose to use, we have selected 4 pins for each of the LED light. 

The Arduino kit is also connected to the power source (battery), there are a few LEDs on the board with push button and capacitor on each of them, this allows the user to control the electric flows from battery to LED light, when the push button is pressed, the LED will light up and one unique sound will be make up in that specific LED.



In this gameplay, there are four LEDs, so as 4 different sounds with each LED. 

As mentioned, the game starts by itself, what the player does is to press the button in which the LEDs have lighted up, every button needs to be pressed according to the order, one wrong button means a fail to the game.
